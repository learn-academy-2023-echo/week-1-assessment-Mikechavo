# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: open source verison controller

Researched answer: "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: logic operator

Researched answer: "The logical OR ( || ) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value."

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: an array is a combination of values and data types and it's index is each individual data type aand its value is the collection of the array itself

Researched answer: "Index: used as a reference to the actual place holder in the element's value of an array"

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: arrays can be a combination of strings which is a data type. strings are considered a singular index and an array can have multiple indexs

Researched answer: "Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character"

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming invloves a pair of individuals. One a "Navigator" which instructs and walks through the steps while the other on writes the code, helps with spelling, coding, placement, etc. Two a "Driver" which conducts the typing of the code, essentially the one behind the wheel. The roles are often switched.

Researched answer: "Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently."

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A "Higher Order Function" is a function that accecpts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: "Jest" is a JS testing framewrok dsigned to ensure correctness of an JS code base.

3. Objects: "Objects" are a collection of properties. A property is association between a name and value.

4. Method: "Method" is a property of an "Object" that contains a defined function.

5. Classes: "Classes" are a template for creating things.
